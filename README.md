# Ball-Bouncing

Welcome to the Ball Bouncing Simulation Repository!

**What's inside:**

1. **Simulation Setup:** Start by running "Ball Bouncing\bounce_DataFile.m" to prepare the simulation data.

2. **Launch the Fun:** Open and run "Ball Bouncing\bounce.slx" to witness the exciting world of ball bouncing in action.

**What to explore:**

Tweak simulation parameters to observe different bouncing behaviors and outcomes.

**Extra Resource:**

There's a helpful PDF document in the repository for reference, whether you want to modify the simulation or embark on a new project.

This repository is your gateway to a world of exciting possibilities in the realm of Simulink simulations.
